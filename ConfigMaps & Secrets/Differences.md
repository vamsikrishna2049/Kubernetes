### Key Differences Between ConfigMaps and Secrets:
1. **Sensitive Data Handling:** ConfigMaps store non-sensitive data, while Secrets store sensitive data like passwords and API keys.
2. **Encryption:** Secrets are typically stored with base64 encoding and are encrypted (if configured in Kubernetes), whereas ConfigMaps are not encrypted.
3. **Access Control:** Secrets can have tighter access control mechanisms due to their sensitive nature.

### Summary:
- **ConfigMaps** are for general configuration settings and non-sensitive data.
- **Secrets** are for managing sensitive data such as credentials, tokens, and keys.
- Both are used to decouple configuration and sensitive data from application code, making the application easier to manage and more secure.
