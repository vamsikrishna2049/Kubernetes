ls /etc/kubernetes/manifests
Location for yaml files for the pods.
You just create the YAML file. No need to run any command, pod will create automatically.
If any YAML file is deleted, then corresponding pod will be deleted.

how many ways you can create an K8s pod?
07:18 run, create, YAML, Deployments, statefulset Static pod( /etc/kuberenetes/manifests), Daemonsets, bare pod, replica-set pod, helm

POd, replicaset, deployment, services, 
	statefulsets,
	Daemonsets,
	static path

How to check the static pod location?
ps -ef | grep static
--config= /etc/kubernetes/manifests

How to schedule pods and probe?
Note:
Whenever we give an instruction to create a pod to the master node. Scheduler from master node will decide to schedule the pod in node01/node02,.. location. 

pod Scheduling; 
We can decide this pod must be run on node01.

If node01 is not available, then it will be in pending stage.

Scheduling the pods:
1. NodeName			Only Node name
2. NodeSelector			All Labels names must be matched. else it will be in pending stage.
3. PodAffinity			inside a node atleast single pod must be run + labels must be matched.
4. Pod AntiAffinity		Exactly opp to pod affinity. i.e., pod must be run on any node + labels must not be matched.
5. NodeAffinity

6. Taint and Toleration
