### Deploy the Blue version (myblue.yaml):
```bash
kubectl apply -f myblue.yaml
```

### Deploy the Green version (mygreen.yaml):
```bash
kubectl apply -f mygreen.yaml
```

### Create the Service (myapp-service.yaml):
```bash
kubectl apply -f myapp-service.yaml
```

### Switch Traffic to Green: Once you're confident the Green deployment is ready and healthy, update the service to point to the Green deployment.
### Update the service selector from version: blue to version: green:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp
    version: green  # Now routing to the Green version
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```

### Apply the change:
```bash
kubectl apply -f myapp-service.yaml
```
### Scale Down or Delete Blue Deployment (Optional): After switching traffic to Green, you can scale down or delete the Blue deployment:
```bash
kubectl scale deployment myapp-blue --replicas=0
```
          
###### Or 
          
### delete the Blue deployment entirely:
```bash
kubectl delete deployment myapp-blue
```
