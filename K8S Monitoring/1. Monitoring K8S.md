# Monitoring in Kubernetes

Kubernetes (also referred to as K8s) is inherently complex and presents numerous challenges when striving for complete observability.

Because of that, to fully learn how to monitor in Kubernetes using Prometheus, we have to first talk about:
What Kubernetes is
1. Why it's important to monitor your Kubernetes infrastructure
2. The architecture that it is necessary to monitor
3. How to identify key metrics for observation
 
## What is Kubernetes?
As a straightforward definition, Kubernetes is an open source platform that allows you to deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications or microservices.

## Why monitor Kubernetes?
There are already many reasons why being aware of system health is important, including optimizing cost and resource usage, eliminating system performance bottlenecks, obtaining key insights, and mitigating security risks. 

However, when maintaining Kubernetes infrastructure, it's especially important to maintain system observability.

Kubernetes isn't simple behind-the-scenes. If you've ever taken the time to fully delve into all the associated components that make up a Kubernetes cluster, you'll find that there's a lot of different considerations to be aware of.

This image here displays the components of a Kubernetes cluster. 

 

Kubernetes cluster image displays the components of a Kubernetes cluster. When you create a Kubernetes cluster, you're creating an individual worker machine or Node that holds the containerized application or microservice. The Node hosts the Pods that comprise each application workload. Meanwhile, the Control Plane is composed of the different applications that make up Kubernetes itself that ensure it can manage each node and pod contained within each node. 1 The image is arranged to show the relationship between the different components of the cluster, with the Control Plane at the top and the Nodes and Pods below it.

When you create a Kubernetes cluster, you're creating an individual worker machine or node that holds the containerized application or microservice. The node hosts the pods that comprise each application workload. Meanwhile, the Control Plane is composed of the different applications that make up Kubernetes itself that ensure it can manage each node and pod contained within each node.

Of course, the whole idea of Kubernetes and container orchestration platforms is that everything is highly scalable. So, as you continue to add nodes for redundancy and high availability, and scale up the amount of applications or microservices you have running, you're very quickly growing the number of components running within the infrastructure. 

See the problem? Each of these components is interdependent on the next making it very complicated to pinpoint or track problems that occur. 

 
## Taking a closer look
To fully visualize all the different components that are installed out-of-the-box, you can always fetch the full list using the Kubernetes command-line client.

For this course, the Kubernetes environment is MicroK8s: a minimal open-source deployment of Kubernetes that's simplified for quick setups. 

It’s a clean installation with no additional changes besides ensuring the DNS server, registry, and dashboard services are enabled. When I retrieve all components installed with my base installation, I get the following results:

Everything returned above is an important factor that contributes to the overall operation of the kube-system namespace, which is the space Kubernetes uses to manage its own services and objects, along with the container-registry functionality. No clusters are created yet and there aren’t any sidecar applications like Istio, yet there's already about 30 associated objects. 

Not already on Kubernetes? You can get started with a development environment quickly using MicroK8s like me. Refer to the official documentation for installation instructions on whatever environment you’re currently running.

 
## Monitoring K8s is essential for success
All of the issues that come with not monitoring a system grow the more you take advantage of the scalability that Kubernetes natively possesses, from performance issues to security risks. Being proactive about the observability stack in your infrastructure can help you avoid a lot of problems later on, and can even help you save on costs and time spent managing the system.

## Key Kubernetes metrics
Specifically for Kubernetes, as you might imagine, there are unique metrics that have to be tracked:

1. Cluster status
2. Node metrics
3. Pod status
4. Control plane metrics
5. Ingress metrics
6. Storage volume health
 
Because it's a distributed system, there are many additional concerns that aren't typically seen in traditional systems.

Referring to the above terminology from the architecture diagram, right away you see we have to monitor the health of the cluster, node, pod, and control plane. When monitoring clusters, nodes, & pods, you can get valuable insights into resource usage, availability status, replication or autoscaling. 

Checking the control plane status ensures cluster performance can be visualized and analyzed. Because the control plane contains components that are key to the cluster health, staying on top of these metrics ensures you prevent issues that can affect all deployed applications or otherwise ensure availability of your services.

Then, you also need to consider ingress traffic metrics, which are collected differently depending on whether you're using external load balances or ingress controllers. Finally, the data storage volume is considered for anything requiring persistent storage. This is going to differ in implementation as well depending on if you're self managing or using a managed SaaS service.
