## Working with Prometheus

![Prometheus Working](https://github.com/vamsikrishna2049/Kubernetes/blob/5217edd0afe35f42a2acfd29b97211e9985c32ad/K8S%20Monitoring/Prometheus%20Architecture%20-Working.png)

In order to understand how to work with Prometheus, we’ll again reference the architecture chart and start out learning about Prometheus targets that are available to use.

Prometheus scrapes specified targets through collecting metrics from defined HTTP endpoints. In the main configuration file ```prometheus.yml```, you can set up Prometheus to collect metrics on itself so it can actually scrape and monitor its own health. You can get started working with Prometheus by interacting with these metrics if you don’t already have or want to set up a running application.

You can follow the [official Prometheus documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/#configuring-prometheus-to-monitor-itself) to define an entry within prometheus.yml that allows Prometheus to monitor itself, and ```curl``` or navigate to localhost:9090/metrics thereafter to verify all is working as expected.


Doing so will return a result similar to the following, but much lengthier:

```bash
# HELP go_gc_duration_seconds A summary of the pause duration of garbage collection cycles.
# TYPE go_gc_duration_seconds summary
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0"} 2.5292e-05
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.25"} 0.000727833
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.5"} 0.000871416
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.75"} 0.001259542
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="1"} 0.041862749
go_gc_duration_seconds_sum 0.310401426
go_gc_duration_seconds_count 242
# HELP go_goroutines Number of goroutines that currently exist.
# TYPE go_goroutines gauge
go_goroutines 32
```

These metric values can be referenced when using [Prometheus' query language PromQL](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#time-series-selectors) to select and aggregate time series data in real time and gain deeper insights into system health. 

PromQL expressions are entered in the Prometheus expression browser, accessible from localhost:9090/graph by default. Here, you can enter any expression in order to render the result in a table or graph the result over time.

 As an example, you can just type in the name of the metric you’re looking to know more about. For example, to know more about prometheus_target_interval_length_seconds:
 

Image showing a Prometheus table or graph with the result over time.   As an example the metric prometheus_target_interval_length_seconds: is displayed in 5 rows increasing in time from 14.9971 to 15.0034

_Note: If you followed along with the suggested setup from the previous lesson, you’ll notice that after you’ve exposed Prometheus’ service to make it accessible from your local machine, you’ll be able to work with these metrics straightaway as the system is already configured to scrape this endpoint._

## Using exporters
Exporters are tools that help export metrics from third-party systems into Prometheus for consumption and aggregation. It's not always possible to directly monitor a system with Prometheus (such as PostgreSQL or Hadoop), so these libraries and servers are designed to address this gap. Within the Prometheus docs are several resources for finding officially recommended or available exporters for specific software and hardware systems.


An industry standard recommended for the integration of machine metrics is node_exporter, an officially maintained and fully open source exporter for hardware and OS metrics. Similarly, the blackbox exporter is also maintained by Prometheus for monitoring the availability and performance of external services or endpoints through probing over protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, TCP, and ICMP.

_Note: Both of these exporters come installed out-of-the-box within the monitoring & observability stack kube-prometheus recommended for use if setting up a unique local test environment on minikube for this course._

No matter which exporters you end up integrating, each will have an unique endpoint that can be accessed through an exposed IP address to verify metrics collection. Multiple targets can be scraped at a time within Prometheus, so take your time to look into it & decide if additional specific exporters are necessary in order to build out a complete monitoring stack for your infrastructure.
