## Setting Up Prometheus

Setting up Prometheus once you have your initial Kubernetes installation is fairly straightforward. Prometheus makes installation easy with a number of different ways to set up your environment. After you’ve reviewed installation instructions and gotten started accordingly, you’ll need to link Prometheus to Kubernetes to ensure the two are communicating. We’ll review a few different ways to achieve both of these things.

But first, let's make sure you have a working Kubernetes installation.

## Installing Kubernetes
For the purposes of this course, we’ll be using minikube to run a local development environment. It’s a lightweight and flexible K8s manager that lets you get started quickly on Linux, Windows, or MacOS.

It can be set up easily using Docker or a similar style of container or Virtual Machine manager like VirtualBox or VMWare. Generally, this is considered a highly recommended option for enabling a local development environment. The official docs include a Getting Started guide which will be your best bet for installing Kubernetes for the first time if you don’t already have a functioning installation.

Note: Make sure to alias the minikube command according to their official docs in order to follow along with commands in this tutorial moving forward. To do this, add this string to your shell config and reload the file:

```bash
alias kubectl="minikube kubectl --"
```

Want to try alternative Kubernetes installation methods? Check out the official Kubernetes documentation; they have an excellent getting started tutorial that will get you on your way no matter whether you're looking to get started with a learning or production environment, or simply ensure you're employing best practices. 

As an additional option, if you’re looking to just get started in a temporary Kubernetes environment, you can always use Killercoda or play with Kubernetes in the browser.

## Need a sample application for a local dev environment?
What if you don’t have an application and already functional development or production infrastructure, but you still want to follow along with this course? 

Continuing along with the recommendations suitable for working with minikube, you’d want to take a look at the Hello Minikube tutorial provided by Kubernetes, which walks you through setting up a sample NGINX application that would be suitable for reproducing the concepts demonstrated within this course.

## Installing Prometheus
The Prometheus docs have an excellent [first steps](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/) walkthrough along with [general](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/) installation instructions that both cover a wide range of environments and installation requirements.

Most official Prometheus components are available as a pre-compiled binary except for certain unsupported versions of the software. This is the most straightforward approach. Support is provided in the form of actively-maintained images hosted on the [official Prometheus downloads page](https://prometheus.io/download/).

It is possible to [install Prometheus from source](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus). To do this, you'd reference Makefile targets in the Prometheus repository after cloning or forking the repository within your local development environment.

If you decide to install using Docker images, you can reference the official Prometheus images hosted on Quay.io and Docker Hub. After your Docker container is set up for the first time, Prometheus can be started anytime using a simple docker run command.

Alternatively, third-party configuration management systems are supported that can all automate the installation and management of Prometheus. Prometheus specifically recommends Ansible, Chef, Puppet, and SaltStack. 

Finally, Prometheus-as-a-Service is available as a fully managed service provided on-premises by Grafana Labs as part of their Grafana Enterprise Metrics solution. Similar options are available from ObserveNow, Logz.io, and Google Cloud at the time of writing this, and it is well worth researching other fully hosted or managed services available for Prometheus if you’re seeking to get started quickly and reliably in a production environment.

## The resulting architecture
In the end, your environment prior to continuing to the course should end up with these components running and installed:

Each of these components will be discussed more in-depth later in the course.

There are many sources of official (and non-official) guides, videos, walkthroughs, and documentation for each of these products. Each and every person’s environment is incredibly unique, so specific installation instructions will not be provided here as there’s simply no way to be accommodating of everyone’s architecture. This course will focus on explaining Prometheus on Kubernetes as high-level concepts to help you understand how it all works and what’s possible using these technologies, but you’ll need to do the research to get it installed.

Note: For the purposes of creating a completely clean test environment for this course, I used the Prometheus Operator kube-prometheus package: a set of example configurations for a complete cluster monitoring stack that uses Prometheus, the Prometheus Operator, Alertmanager, node_exporter, and other associated and necessary components of a complete monitoring stack for Prometheus on Kubernetes. See the instructions specifically written for minikube.

## Running Prometheus with command-line flags
It’s important to point out that when you do get started with Prometheus, there are a variety of [command-line flags](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/command-line/prometheus/) that can be passed at server start. 

For example, if you are running metrics visualization at scale and have more than 20 dashboard panels all loading concurrently, you’ll run into latency problems from Prometheus overload. By default, Prometheus runs with a maximum of 20 concurrent queries permitted at one time. In order to raise this limit, you can use the configuration flag ```--query.max-concurrency=<N>``` where <N> is the newly defined number of concurrent queries to be allowed.

On the other hand, if you have a need to defend Prometheus’ availability from expensive queries, you can use combinations of the flags ```--query.max-samples```, ```--query.max-concurrency```, and ```---query.timeout```. 

In other words: the command line and Prometheus’ documentation is your friend. There are a lot of defaults that can cause havoc within your infrastructure if you aren’t expecting these overrides to be present!
