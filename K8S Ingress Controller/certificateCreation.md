# Certbot SSL Certificate Setup with DNS Challenge (Route53)
## 1. Installing Certbot
Install Certbot using Snap
Certbot is a tool that automates the process of obtaining and renewing SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt. To install Certbot on your server:
```xml
sudo snap install --classic certbot
```
## Create a Symlink for Easier Access
After installation, create a symbolic link to /usr/local/bin/ for easy access to Certbot commands:
```xml
cd /snap/bin
cp certbot /usr/local/bin/
```
This ensures you can run certbot from any directory.

# Verify the Installation
To confirm that Certbot was installed successfully, run:
```xml
certbot -h
```
This will display the Certbot help menu with available commands and options.

# 2. Requesting an SSL Certificate -Command to Request the Certificate
Run the following command to request an SSL certificate for your wildcard domain *.practisedomain.cloud using DNS-01 challenge:
```xml
    certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns --key-type rsa --email vamsikrishna2049@gmail.com \
      --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory --agree-tos -d "*.practisedomain.cloud"
```
Explanation of Flags:
--manual: Use manual mode to handle DNS challenges.
--preferred-challenges dns: Specifies the DNS-01 challenge type.
--key-type rsa: Use RSA key algorithm.
--email vamsikrishna2049@gmail.com: Contact email for the certificate.
--agree-tos: Agree to Let's Encrypt's terms of service.
-d "*.practisedomain.cloud": Request a wildcard certificate for the domain practisedomain.cloud.

## Approve the Terms of Service
## Once the command is executed, Certbot will ask for confirmation of the Terms of Service. Type Yes to proceed.

# 3. DNS Validation Setup in AWS Route53
Add DNS Record in Route53
Certbot will prompt you to create a TXT record in your DNS provider (Route53 in this case) to prove domain ownership.

## Log in to your AWS Route53 console.
Select the hosted zone for your domain (practisedomain.cloud).
Add a new DNS record:
Record Name: ```xml
_acme-challenge
```
Record Type: 
```xml
TXT
```
Record Value: 
```xml
9Y2EdG0nT0QNaJtGtIN-Euu1zc9ZVuCz2mhAe_SO3os
```
This value will be provided by Certbot after initiating the process.

Save the record.

## DNS Propagation (Wait for 2-3 min)
It may take several minutes for the DNS record to propagate. Certbot will attempt to verify the DNS record before issuing the certificate.

# 4. Finalizing and Locating SSL Certificate Files
Once the validation is complete and the certificate is issued, you can find the certificate and private key in the following directory:

``` xml
Certificate (tls.crt): /etc/letsencrypt/live/practisedomain.cloud/fullchain.pem
Private Key (tls.key): /etc/letsencrypt/live/practisedomain.cloud/privkey.pem
```
## Certificate Expiry Date
Your SSL certificate will be valid for 90 days. The expiration date can be found in the following location:
Expiration Date: 2025-03-01

Make sure to renew your certificate before this date using Certbotâ€™s automated renewal process.
