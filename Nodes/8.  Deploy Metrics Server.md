Kubeadm doesnâ€™t install metrics server component during its initialization. We have to install it separately.

To verify this, if you run the top command, you will see the Metrics API not available error.
```bash
kubectl top nodes
```
Deploy the metrics server using the following manifest. It gets deployed in the kube-system namespace
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/techiescamp/kubeadm-scripts/main/manifests/metrics-server.yaml
```
Validate the deployment
```bash
kubectl get deployment metrics-server -n kube-system
```

Once the metrics server objects are deployed, it may take a minute before you can see the node and pod metrics using the top command.

Use the following command to check the node CPU and memory.
```bash
kubectl top nodes
```

You should be able to view the node metrics as shown below.
```bash
kubectl top nodes

NAME           CPU(cores)   CPU%   MEMORY(bytes)   MEMORY%
controlplane   58m          2%     1425Mi          37%
node01         11m          0%     1010Mi          26%
node02         219m         21%    980Mi           52%
```

You can also view the pod CPU and memory metrics using the following command.
```bash
kubectl top pod -n kube-system
```
