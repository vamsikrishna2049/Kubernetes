To enable pod networking, you need to install a CNI plugin.

We will use Calico CNI plugin for our cluster.

Execute the following command from the controlplane to deploy the Calico network plugin.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://docs.projectcalico.org/manifests/calico.yaml
```
Validate the Calico deployment by listing the Calico pods. It may take a few minutes for the Calico pods to reach the running state.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep calico

calico-kube-controllers-658d97c59c-2kdm6   1/1     Running   0              4m44s
calico-node-h62cq                          1/1     Running   0              4m44s
calico-node-kgpx5                          1/1     Running   0              4m44s
calico-node-wgdw7                          1/1     Running   0              4m44s
calico-node-xs8mk                          1/1     Running   0              4m44s
```
Once the Calico pods are running successfully, you can check the status of the CoreDNS pods and cluster nodes.

The CoreDNS pods should be changed to the Running state, and the nodes should changed to Ready state.

## Why we need CNI Plugin?
CNI plugin in Kubernetes acts like a network adapter for your containers. It essentially does three key things:

**1. Configures network interfaces:**
    It connects containers to the outside world by creating network interfaces and making necessary adjustments on the host system.
**2. Assigns IP addresses:** 
    It assigns unique IP addresses to each container, enabling them to communicate with each other and with external resources.
**3. Enabling Network Policy:** 
    Network policies act as firewalls for your pods, defining which pods can communicate with each other and with external resources. Network policies only work if the underlying CNI plugin can enforce them.
