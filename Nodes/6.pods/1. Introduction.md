As we know, Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that deploys our application's containers. But it does not deploy containers directly. All the containers are encapsulated into a Kubernetes object called Pod.

A Pod is the smallest deployable unit representing a single instance of an application. Think of it as a small box where your app lives.

So how does it differ from a container?

A container is a single unit. However, a pod can contain more than one container. You can think of pods as a box that can hold one or more containers together.

A pod contains one or more containers, shared storage, and network resources. We can run multiple instances of our application by increasing the number of pods.

In a nutshell, here is what you should know about a pod:
1. Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes.
2. Pods are ephemeral in nature; they can be created, deleted, and updated.
3. A pod can have more than one container; there is no limit to how many containers you can run inside a pod.
4. Each pod gets a unique IP address.
5. Pods communicate with each other using the IP address.
6. Containers inside a pod connect using localhost on different ports.
7. Containers running inside a pod should have different port numbers to avoid port clashes.
8. You can set CPU and memory resources for each container running inside the pod.
9. Containers inside a pod share the same volume mount.
10. All the containers inside a pod are scheduled on the same node; It cannot span multiple nodes.

## Creating Pod
You can create a pod in two ways

**1. Using the kubectl imperative command:** Imperative commands allow you to create and manage Kubernetes objects directly from the command line without needing to write a configuration file. It is primarily used for quick tasks, testing and certification purposes. The imperative command comes with its own limitations.
**2. Declarative approach:** In the declarative approach, you write a YAML file that describes the desired state of your application. This file is called a manifest. This approach is preferred for production deployments and project work because it allows you to keep version-controlled configurations of your infrastructure, making it easier to deploy, update, and replicate environments.
