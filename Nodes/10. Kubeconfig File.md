A Kubeconfig is a YAML file with all the Kubernetes cluster details, certificates, and secret tokens to authenticate the cluster. .

When you use kubectl, it uses the information in the kubeconfig file to connect to the kubernetes cluster API.

The default location of the Kubeconfig file is $HOME/.kube/config

We have this file in the control plane node under /root/.kube/config

If you open the file, you will see the following details in the Kubeconfig file.
```bash
cat .kube/config 
```
1. certificate-authority-data: Cluster CA
2. server: Cluster endpoint (IP/DNS of the master node)
3. name: Cluster name
4. user: name of the user/service account
5. token: Secret token of the user/service account.

## Connecting the Cluster From Local Workstation
You might have the kubeadm cluster on Vagrant VMs or cloud VMs.
You don't have to always login to the control plane node to execute kubectl commands
You can connect to the cluster from your local workstation terminal using **kubectl** using the Kubeconfig file.
For cloud VMs ensure the control plane node is configured with a Public IP. Or else you cannot connect to the cluster from your workstation.

## Step 1: Install kubectl on your workstation. Use the official installation guide to install it based on your operating system.

## Step 2: Create a .kube directory in the users home.
```bash
mkdir $HOME/.kube
```

Windows user need to create the folder in the following structure.
```bash
C:\Users\[Your-Username]\.kube
```

## Step 3: From the controlplane node copy the /root/.kube/config file content and create a file named config under the .kube folder in your workstation.
```bash
vi $HOME/.kube/config
```
## Step 4: Validate the cluster connectivity by running the following command.

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

## Real World Example
In actual project environments (Cloud & On Prem), cluster RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) can be mapped with normal IAM (Identity and Access Management) users. For example, AWS IAM or Azure Active Directory services.
This allows organizations to control access to the cluster based on IAM policies, which can be used to create restrictive cluster access.
