## etcd Backup
To perform a backup, you need to provide the following four pieces of information to etcdctl as command-line arguments.
1. etcd endpoint (–endpoints)
2. ca certificate (–cacert)
3. server certificate (–cert)
4. server key (–key)

You can get the above details in two ways.

## Method 1: From the etcd static pod manifest file located at /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml the location
```bash
cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml
```
![Method-1](https://github.com/vamsikrishna2049/Kubernetes/blob/e3fa863f2db5f7c22e5d6b860178ec6279c42fe6/Nodes/images/3.ETCD%20and%20ETCDL/ETCD%20BackUP%20Method-1.png)
## Method 2: You can also get the above details by describing the etcd pod running in the kube-system namespace.
```bash
kubectl get po -n kube-system
kubectl describe po etcd-controlplane -n kube-system
```

Create a backup directory.
```
sudo mkdir -p /opt/backup/
```

To take an etcd snapshot backup use the following command syntax.

```bash
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl \
  --endpoints=<etcd endpoint> \
  --cacert=<ca-file> \
  --cert=<cert-file> \
  --key=<key-file> \
  snapshot save <backup-file-location>
```

**ETCDCTL_API=3** specifies that the etcdctl CLI should use API version 3.

The command looks like the following when you add the actual endpoint, location and parameters. Replace 192.168.201.10 with your etc endpoint you found it method 1.

text
$ ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl \
  --endpoints=https://192.168.201.10:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
  --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
  --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
  snapshot save /opt/backup/etcd.db
Run the above command to perform a back up. It will save the backup in the /opt/backup/ location..

On a successful execution you will get a “**Snapshot saved at /opt/backup/etcd.db**”, message as shown below.
![Method-2](https://github.com/vamsikrishna2049/Kubernetes/blob/e3fa863f2db5f7c22e5d6b860178ec6279c42fe6/Nodes/images/3.ETCD%20and%20ETCDL/ETCD%20BackUP%20Method-2.png)


Now, you can verify the snapshot status using the following command.

```bash
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --write-out=table snapshot status /opt/backup/etcd.db
or 
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl -w table snapshot status /opt/backup/etcd.db
```

Here is an example output.
```bash
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --write-out=table snapshot status /opt/backup/etcd.db

+----------+----------+------------+------------+
|   HASH   | REVISION | TOTAL KEYS | TOTAL SIZE |
+----------+----------+------------+------------+
| 97bb9b01 |    39304 |        897 |     2.1 MB |
+----------+----------+------------+------------+
```

## etcd Restore
Now we have the backup in the /opt/backup/etcd.db location. We will use the snapshot backup to restore etcd to **/opt/etcd** location

Here is the command to **restore etcd**. Here we pass **--data-dir** flag with **/opt/etcd** directory. It is the target directory where the restored data will be placed.

```bash
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl \
  --data-dir /opt/etcd \
  --endpoints=https://192.168.201.10:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
  --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
  --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
  snapshot restore /opt/backup/etcd.db
```
On a successful restore, you will get the output logs as shown below.

```bash
2024-02-07 08:47:35.667741 I | mvcc: restore compact to 38682
2024-02-07 08:47:35.672240 I | etcdserver/membership: added member 8e9e05c52164694d [http://localhost:2380] to cluster cdf818194e3a8c32
```
After restoring, we need to update the /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml as in the configuration it points to the older path. We have now restored the etcd snapshot to a new path so the only change to be made in the YAML file, is to change the hostPath for the volume called etcd-data from the old directory (/var/lib/etcd) to the new directory (/opt/etcd).

Edit the ``etcd.yaml`` and change the volume:

yaml
volumes:
  - hostPath:
      path: /opt/etcd
      type: DirectoryOrCreate
    name: etcd-data
The etcd pod will automatically created with new configuration and you would be able to see the previous data.

Also, if you want to change --data-dir to /opt/etcd in the etcd manifest, make sure that the volumeMounts for etcd-data is updated as well, with the mountPath pointing to /opt/etcd

### Note 1: The default etcd data directory is /var/lib/etcd

### Note 2: For the restore command we don't need to pass the certificates and keys. We can directly run the below command as well.

```bash
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl \
--data-dir <data-dir-location> \
snapshot restore <backup-file-location>
```

### Note 3: Use etcdutl instead of etcdctl as it is deprecrated in the version etcd v3.5.x 

### Exam Scenario
In the CKA exam, you will be tested on etcd backup and restore procedures. The etcdctl client will be available in the exam environment. You dont have to install it. You have to use the parameters and directory locations specified in the task to perform the backup and restore operations.
