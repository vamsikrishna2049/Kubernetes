We will use a kubeadm-based cluster setup for the CKA practice lab because the exam environment is based on a kubeadm setup.

The CKA exam heavily emphasizes your ability to perform real-world tasks, not just theoretical knowledge.

Setting up a Kubernetes cluster with kubeadm gives you practical experience with the entire process, from bootstrapping the control plane to joining worker nodes and configuring networking.

## VM Prerequisites

If you are using our Vagrantfile for VMs, the hostname entries are already included in the setup.
If you are deploying cloud VMs, Use the following hostnames for controlplane and worker nodes

1. controlplane
2. node01
3. node02

# Note:
If you are unable to set the hostname directly, update the /etc /hosts entry on all the nodes.

## IP Address
If you are deploying VMs on the cloud and want to access the cluster from your local workstation, assign a static public IP address to the control plane node.
This way, you can shut down the VMs when not in use, and the control plane IP will remain the same. All the cluster configurations remain intact when you restart the VMs.


## Firewall Requirements
If you are deploying VMs on the cloud, ensure you have the following ports opened in the firewall settings.

Allow all port access between nodes and the 6443 and 30000-32767 port ranges from your workstation.
