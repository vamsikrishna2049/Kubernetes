In Kubernetes, all the components talk to each other over mTLS. Under the PKI folder, you will find all the TLS certificates and keys. Kubernetes control plane components use these certificates to authenticate and communicate with each other.

Also, there is an etcd subdirectory that contains the etcd-specific certificates and private keys. These are used to secure communication between etcd nodes and between the API server and etcd nodes.

```bash
cd /etc/kubernetes/pki 
```

The following image shows the file structure of the PKI folder.

The static pod manifests refer to the required TLS certificates and keys from this folder.

When you work on a self-hosted cluster using tools like kubeadm, these certificates are automatically generated by the tool. In managed kubernetes clusters, the cloud provider takes care of all the TLS requirements as it is their responsibility to manage control plane components.

However, if you are setting up a self-hosted cluster for production use, these certificates have to be requested from the organization’s network or security team. They will generate these certificates signed by the organization’s internal Certificate authority and provide them to you.
