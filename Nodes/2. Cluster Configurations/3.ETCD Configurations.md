If you want to interact with the etcd component, you can use the details from the static pod YAML.

For example, if you want to backup etcd you need to know the etcd service endpoint and related certificates to authenticate against etcd and create a backup.

If you open the etcd.yaml manifest you can view all the etcd-related configurations as shown below.

```bash
cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml
```
