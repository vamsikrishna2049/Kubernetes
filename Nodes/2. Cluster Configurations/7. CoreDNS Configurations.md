CoreDNS addon components deal with the cluster DNS configurations.
All the CoreDNS configurations are part of a configmap named CoreDNS in the kubesystem namespace.

If you list the Configmaps in the kube-system namespace, you can see the CoreDNS configmap.

```bash
kubectl get configmap --namespace=kube-system
```
![coreDNS](https://github.com/vamsikrishna2049/Kubernetes/blob/67e187e5c49ccadfa3ca5b3732650805bee706bd/Nodes/images/2.7%20core%20DNS%20Config.png)

Use the following command to view the **CoreDNS** configmap contents.
```bash
k edit configmap coredns --namespace=kube-system
```
You will see the following contents.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  Corefile: |
    .:53 {
        errors
        health {
           lameduck 5s
        }
        ready
        kubernetes cluster.local in-addr.arpa ip6.arpa {
           pods insecure
           fallthrough in-addr.arpa ip6.arpa
           ttl 30
        }
        prometheus :9153
        forward . /etc/resolv.conf {
           max_concurrent 1000
        }
        cache 30
        loop
        reload
        loadbalance
    }
```

When it comes to DNS connectivity, applications may need to connect to:
1. Internal services using Kubernetes service endpoints.
2. Publicly available services using public DNS endpoints.
3. In hybrid cloud environments, services are hosted in on-premise environments using private DNS endpoints.

If you have a use case where you need to have custom DNS servers, for example, the applications in the cluster need to connect to private DNS endpoints in the on-premise data center, you can add the custom DNS server to the core DNS configmap configurations.

For example, letâ€™s say the custom DNS server IP is 10.45.45.34 and your DNS suffix is dns-onprem.com, we have to add a block as shown below. So that all the DNS requests related to that domain endpoint will be forwarded to 10.45.45.34 DNS server. 

```yaml
dns-onprem.com:53 {
    errors
    cache 30
    forward . 10.45.45.34
}
```

Here is the full configmap configuration with the custom block highlighted in bold.

``` yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  Corefile: |
    .:53 {
        errors
        health {
           lameduck 5s
        }
        ready
        kubernetes cluster.local in-addr.arpa ip6.arpa {
           pods insecure
           fallthrough in-addr.arpa ip6.arpa
           ttl 30
        }
        prometheus :9153
        forward . /etc/resolv.conf {
           max_concurrent 1000
        }
        cache 30
        loop
        reload
        loadbalance
    }
    dns-onprem.com:53 {
    errors
    cache 30
    forward . 10.45.45.34
    }
```
