All the control plane components are started by the kubelet from the static pod manifests present in the /etc/kubernetes/manifests directory.

```bash
cd /etc/kubernetes/manifests
```

This means you can create pods by providing a pod YAML location to the Kubelet component. However, static pods created by Kubelet are not managed by the API server. It is typically used only for cluster bootstrapping purposes.

The following components are deployed from the static pod manifests.
1. etcd
2. API server
3. Kube controller manager
4. Kube scheduler

```bash
manifests
  ├── etcd.yaml
  ├── kube-apiserver.yaml
  ├── kube-controller-manager.yaml
  └── kube-scheduler.yaml
```
You can get all the configuration locations of these components from these pod manifests.

## Making permanent changes To Control Plane Components
To make permanent changes to control plane components (such as the API server, controller manager, or scheduler) in a Kubernetes cluster, you must update their static pod manifest files.

From a CKA perspective, if you're tasked with troubleshooting a control plane component and need to modify it, you should edit the respective static pod manifest file to ensure the changes are permanent.
