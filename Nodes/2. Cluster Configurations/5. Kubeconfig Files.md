Any components that need to authenticate to the API server need the kubeconfig file.

All the cluster Kubeconfig files are present in the /etc/kubernetes folder (.conf files).

```bash
cd /etc/kubernetes
```

You will find the following files.
1. admin.conf
2. controller-manager.conf
3. kubelet.conf
4. scheduler.conf

It contains the API server endpoint, cluster CA certificate, cluster client certificate, and other information.

The **admin.conf**, file, which is the admin kubeconfig file used by end users to access the API server to manage the clusters. You can use this file to connect the cluster from a remote workstation.

The Kubeconfig for the Controller manager, scheduler, and Kubelet is used for API server authentication and authorization.

For example, if you check the Controller Manager static pod manifest file, you can see the **controller-manager.conf** added as the authentication and authorization parameter.
